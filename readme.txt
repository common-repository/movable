== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I start using the Movable plugin? =
Make sure you're using the Gutenberg block editor, the Movable plugin will not work with the classic editor.  If you want to be on the bleeding edge of WordPress technology you'll want to install the latest version of the [Gutenberg editor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/).
